    abtus:"Having found the similar interest and understanding of the practices in psychotherapy, we decided on creating a     space together which resonated with our ideas of practice.

Alpaviraam (Comma&-punctuation in English) literally means a pause between parts of a sentence, or a small    interval. There is always an Alpaviraam, when the sentences clutter and stop making sense as well as when there    is something more to look forward to. When used properly, these commas help making meaning out of the    sentences much like how we intend to use this space for mental health.An individual develops different parts of oneself through various life experiences. At Alpaviraam, we believe    the major work in therapy is to bring awareness and integration of these parts, however distant they may seem.
